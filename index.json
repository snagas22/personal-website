Looking at businesses today, it is apparent businesses that have been successful in modern days are the ones that have successfully globlized and expanded beyond their home countries. While Japan is one of the most developed countries of the world, it has not been doing too well when it comes to English education. Specifically, people there are falling behind with their accents. Since clear, verbal communications are crucial in anything, I wanted to build an app that can aid development in that vector.\nOverview  Users can select a situation to focus on and will be navigated to a list of phrases appropriate for the chosen situation. Once they tap on one of the phrases, a modal will be presented with a description about the phrase and when to use it in Japanese. In addition, the green button is there to play a sample pronunciation for practice \u0026amp; for emergency use when travelling.\nThe landing page is here (Note: It is mostly written in Japanese as my target audience is Japanese individuals learning English).\nYou can check out the app on the App Store from here.\n","date":1598745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598745600,"objectID":"247897dd635287920f0b0db6d4e953a4","permalink":"https://snagas.github.io/personal-website/project/eigogo/","publishdate":"2020-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/personal-website/project/eigogo/","section":"project","summary":"A Japanese iOS app for learning English.","tags":["Mobile App"],"title":"EiGoGo iOS App","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1598745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598745600,"objectID":"4594a4a3b47bc28044e42c4309f5aaf1","permalink":"https://snagas.github.io/personal-website/project/jsa/","publishdate":"2020-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/personal-website/project/jsa/","section":"project","summary":"A website for Japan Student Association at the University of Michigan.","tags":["Web","Club"],"title":"JSA Website","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
